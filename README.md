# BoCube
My Second Game

This is really simple game that almost like google main page mini game.
Goal of this game is to paint every tile in randomly generated 3D map with rotating cube.

I'm designing this game to be simple as possible, so that average play time will be less than 1 min.
It's because I want players to play this easily & quickly, during waiting for matching in LOL or downloading some big files.

As you can see, there is not that much thing be done, and there are tons of bug already... I'll fix it(hopefully)

I don't care anybody read and reference my c# code in here. It it 'useful' garbage anyway.
Please feel free to use this. Until I finish it and publish it via steam(possible?)
